=============================================================================
KARAOKE DATABASE IMPROVEMENT ANALYSIS SUMMARY
=============================================================================

1. RELEASE YEAR 2025 ISSUE:
   - Current Status: 30 videos (15%) still have release_year = 2025
   - These are all from 2025 uploads where the parser likely extracted "2025"
     from the video title or description
   - Examples show these are legitimate 2025 uploads from channels like:
     * ZZang KARAOKE (Korean karaoke channel)
     * Sing King
   - The issue appears to be that the parser is correctly extracting the year
     from titles that include "2025" but this is the upload year, not the
     original song release year

2. STRING TRUNCATION IMPROVEMENTS:
   ✓ Description field: NO truncation detected
     - Max length: 2001 chars (well below 5000 limit)
     - Average: 1279 chars
     - 0 videos with truncated descriptions

   ✓ Featured artists field: NO truncation detected
     - Max length: 409 chars (below 500 limit)
     - Average: 193 chars
     - 0 videos with truncated featured artists

3. DATA QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS:
   ✓ Metadata extraction: Very successful
     - 100% have artist extracted
     - 100% have song title extracted
     - 79.5% have genre extracted
     - 78% have featured artists extracted

   ✓ Parse confidence: Excellent
     - Average confidence: 94.3%
     - 98.5% have high confidence (≥0.8)
     - 0% have low confidence (<0.5)

4. DISCOGS INTEGRATION:
   ⚠️ No Discogs columns found in current schema
   - The database schema doesn't include Discogs fields yet
   - This suggests the Discogs integration code hasn't been run on this DB

5. OVERALL STATISTICS:
   - Total videos: 200
   - 4 unique channels (50 videos each - appears to be a test dataset)
   - 61% have valid release years (1900-2024)
   - 24% missing release year data
   - 15% have future years (2025)

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. The 2025 issue needs a different approach:
   - Filter out years that match the upload year
   - Add logic to distinguish between upload year in title vs actual release
   - Consider using MusicBrainz/Discogs data to override parsed years

2. Run the Discogs integration pass on this database to get external metadata

3. The string truncation issue appears to be completely resolved in this dataset

4. Consider adding validation to reject release years >= current year
