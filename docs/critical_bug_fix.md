# Critical Bug Fix Required

## Issue Found
The Discogs success rate dropped dramatically from 86.5% to 42.0% due to a Python scope error.

### Root Cause
- Added `import datetime` inside conditional blocks within methods
- When the import was inside an `if` statement, it wasn't available in other parts of the method
- This caused 1,128 "local variable 'datetime' referenced before assignment" errors
- Almost every Discogs result failed to parse

### The Bug
```python
# BAD - import inside if statement
if item.get("year"):
    year = item.get("year")
    import datetime  # Only available inside this if block!
    current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year
    
# Later in the same method...
current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year  # ERROR: datetime not defined!
```

### The Fix
Already applied:
1. Added `import datetime` at the module level (line 4)
2. Removed redundant `import datetime` statements from inside methods

## Impact
- This bug prevented ~58% of videos from getting Discogs data
- The actual improvements (stricter artist matching, K-pop support, etc.) couldn't be properly evaluated
- Need to re-run to see the true effectiveness of the changes

## Next Steps
The user needs to run the script again to properly evaluate the improvements with the bug fixed.
