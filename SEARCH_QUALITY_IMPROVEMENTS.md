  - Parallel and sequential search strategies
  - Result combination and deduplication

- **Smart Search Strategies**
  - Primary search with YouTube provider
  - Automatic fallback trigger (< 10 results threshold)
  - Query reformulation for difficult searches
  - Multiple fallback strategies with different query variations

- **Performance Optimization**
  - Cache warming for popular queries
  - Performance monitoring and statistics
  - Automatic cache optimization
  - Provider health monitoring

### 7. Enhanced Configuration
**Location**: `config.yaml`

- **Multi-Strategy Settings**
  - Provider enabling/disabling
  - Fallback thresholds and limits
  - Parallel vs sequential search options

- **Fuzzy Matching Configuration**
  - Similarity thresholds
  - Phonetic matching parameters
  - Edit distance limits

- **Ranking Weights**
  - Customizable scoring weights
  - Provider-specific adjustments

- **Caching Configuration**
  - TTL settings for each cache level
  - Size limits and optimization parameters

### 8. Enhanced Advanced Parser Integration
**Location**: `collector/advanced_parser.py`

- **Fuzzy Matching Integration**
