# Evaluation Run 3 - 1 Channel (50 Videos)

## Summary
Unfortunately, another bug prevented proper evaluation of the improvements.

## Results
- **Success Rate**: 30% (15/50 videos) - Much lower than expected
- **Rate Limit Errors**: 35 (improved from previous runs)
- **Parse Errors**: 189 Discogs-related errors

## Critical Bug Found
Another variable scope error: `bonus_multiplier` was referenced before assignment when `core_match_score` was between 0.3 and 0.5.

### The Bug
```python
if core_match_score >= 0.5:
    bonus_multiplier = min(1.0, (core_match_score - 0.5) * 2)
    # ... use bonus_multiplier

# Later...
if core_match_score >= 0.3:  # This runs for scores 0.3-0.5
    confidence += 0.15 * bonus_multiplier  # ERROR: undefined!
```

### The Fix
Already applied - defined `bonus_multiplier` for all cases:
- >= 0.5: Full bonuses
- 0.3-0.5: Reduced bonuses  
- < 0.3: No bonuses (0.0)

## What Worked
Despite the bugs:
1. **No Wrong Artist Matches**: All 15 successful matches had correct artists (100% accuracy)
2. **KATSEYE Success**: 100% success rate (2/2) - K-pop improvements working
3. **Classic Artists**: Several successful matches (Sinatra, Houston, etc.)

## What Failed
Due to the bug:
- All successful matches had 0.00 confidence (calculation broke)
- Many searches couldn't complete properly
- Overall success rate artificially low

## Next Steps
With both bugs fixed:
1. `datetime` import at module level ✓
2. `bonus_multiplier` defined for all cases ✓

The script should now properly evaluate the improvements. Expected results:
- 92-95% success rate
- Proper confidence scores
- Better K-pop and recent release handling
