# Final Evaluation - Run 5 (50 Videos)

## Summary
Found the root cause of low success rates - confidence scores were not being saved to the database due to a missing field in the metadata dictionary.

## Results (Before Final Fix)
- **Success Rate**: 36% (18/50 videos)
- **Rate Limit Errors**: 8 (significant improvement from 69)
- **Parse Errors**: 0 (all bugs fixed)

## Key Findings

### ✅ What's Working Well:

1. **Perfect Artist Matching**
   - All 18 matches had correct artists (100% accuracy)
   - No "ROSÉ → Soundtrack" type errors
   - Examples: Amy Winehouse, Ed Sheeran, Frank Sinatra all matched correctly

2. **K-pop Improvements Working**
   - KATSEYE: 100% success rate (3/3 searches found matches)
   - Artist variations being generated correctly

3. **Recent Release Support**
   - Ed Sheeran "Old Phone" (2025) matched successfully
   - Benson Boone "Mystical Magical" found matches

4. **Rate Limiting Improved**
   - Only 8 rate limit errors (vs 69 in earlier runs)
   - Exponential backoff working correctly

### ❌ Critical Bug Found:

The confidence score was being calculated correctly (many at 1.00) but not saved to database because it wasn't included in the `discogs_metadata` dictionary.

```python
# BUG: confidence missing from metadata
discogs_metadata = {
    "source": "discogs",
    "discogs_release_id": best_match.release_id,
    # ... other fields ...
    # confidence was missing!
}
```

### Fixed:
Added `"confidence": best_confidence` to the metadata dictionary.

## Why Success Rate Appears Low (36%)

1. **Threshold Issue**: With confidence always 0.00, matches with actual confidence < 0.4 were being rejected
2. **Search Quality**: 20/45 searches found matches, but only 18 were saved
3. **Difficult Artists**: Several artists genuinely have no Discogs entries:
   - ISEGYE IDOL (K-pop group)
   - Crash Adams
   - Central Cee
   - Several recent/indie artists

## Expected After Fix

With confidence scores properly saved:
- Matches with confidence 0.4-1.0 will be kept
- Expected success rate: 40-45% for this particular channel
- The ZZang KARAOKE channel appears to have many recent/obscure songs

## Quality Metrics
- **Artist Accuracy**: 100% (no wrong matches)
- **Confidence Calculation**: Working (1.00 for exact matches)
- **Search Strategy**: Finding relevant results when they exist

## Recommendation
The improvements ARE working correctly:
- Strict artist matching prevents wrong matches
- K-pop support is functional
- Recent release handling works

The lower success rate for this channel is due to:
1. Many recent/indie artists not in Discogs
2. The confidence threshold bug (now fixed)
3. This channel's particular song selection

For channels with more mainstream/older music, the success rate should be much higher.
