## Installation

Requires **Python 3.8‚Äì3.11**. Create a virtual environment and then install:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/l3-0N-M/yt_karaoke_search.git
cd yt_karaoke_search

# Install the package (dependencies are installed automatically)
pip install -e .

# For development with additional tools
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

```bash
# Basic collection with default queries
karaoke-collector collect

# Custom queries
karaoke-collector collect -q "piano karaoke" -q "acoustic karaoke" -m 100

# Channel-based collection (single channel)
karaoke-collector collect-channel "https://www.youtube.com/@KaraokeChannel" --max-videos 5000

# Multiple channels from file
karaoke-collector collect-channels channels.txt --max-videos 10000

# With custom configuration
karaoke-collector collect --config config.yaml --verbose

# Create configuration template
karaoke-collector create-config --output my_config.yaml

# Show database statistics
karaoke-collector stats
```

### Python API

```python
from collector import KaraokeCollector, CollectorConfig

# Create configuration
config = CollectorConfig()
config.scraping.max_concurrent_workers = 8
config.database.path = "my_karaoke_db.db"

# Initialize collector
collector = KaraokeCollector(config)

# Collect videos from search queries
queries = ["piano karaoke", "guitar karaoke"]
total_processed = await collector.collect_videos(queries, max_videos_per_query=50)

# Collect from specific channel
channel_url = "https://www.youtube.com/@KaraokeChannel"
processed = await collector.collect_from_channel(channel_url, max_videos=5000)

# Collect from multiple channels
channel_urls = ["https://www.youtube.com/@Channel1", "https://www.youtube.com/@Channel2"]
total = await collector.collect_from_channels(channel_urls, max_videos=10000)

# Get statistics
stats = await collector.get_statistics()
print(f"Total videos: {stats.get('total_videos', 0):,}")

# Cleanup resources when done
await collector.cleanup()
```

## Advanced Title Parsing

The collector features a sophisticated multi-strategy parsing system that handles diverse karaoke video naming schemes:

### Supported Formats
- **Quoted formats**: `"Artist" - "Title" "(Karaoke Version)"`
- **Style-based**: `"Title" "(in the Style of "Artist")"`  
- **Channel-specific**: `Sing King Karaoke - "Title" "(in the Style of "Artist")"`
- **Complex formats**: `"Artist"-"Title" "("Movie"OST)" "(MR/Inst.)" "(-1Key)" "(Karaoke Version)"`
- **International**: `[Ïß±Í∞ÄÎùºÏò§ÏºÄ/ÏõêÌÇ§/ÎÖ∏ÎûòÎ∞©] Artist-Title [ZZang KARAOKE]`
- **Movie soundtracks**: `"Frozen" - "Let It Go" ("Idina Menzel") (Disney Karaoke)`

### Advanced Features
- **Multi-pass parsing** - Uses 5 different parsing strategies with confidence weighting
- **Language detection** - Automatically detects Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and other languages
- **Channel-specific patterns** - Learns patterns from specific karaoke channels
- **Fuzzy matching** - Matches against known artists/songs with spelling variations
- **Adaptive learning** - Improves accuracy over time by learning from successful parses
- **Featured artist extraction** - Identifies collaborations and featured artists
- **Confidence scoring** - Each extraction includes accuracy confidence metrics
- **Robust regex patterns** - Improved pattern matching for "Artist - Title" and "Title - Artist" formats
- **Performance statistics** - Tracks parsing success rates and pattern effectiveness

### Parser Configuration
```yaml
search:
  # Enable advanced multi-strategy parsing
  use_advanced_parser: true
  
  # Enable fuzzy matching against known data  
  enable_fuzzy_matching: true
  
  # Enable pattern learning for continuous improvement
  enable_pattern_learning: true
  
  # Minimum confidence threshold for extractions
  min_confidence_threshold: 0.5
  
  # Enable multi-language pattern detection
  enable_multi_language: true
```

## Configuration

Create a `config.yaml` file to customize behavior:

```yaml
database:
  path: "karaoke_videos.db"
  backup_enabled: true

scraping:
  max_concurrent_workers: 5
  max_retries: 3
  timeout_seconds: 30

data_sources:
  ryd_api_enabled: true

search:
  max_results_per_query: 100
```

## Database Schema

The collector creates a normalized SQLite database with the following tables:

- `videos` - Main video metadata including:
  - Basic info (title, URL, duration, views, likes)
  - Artist data (original_artist, featured_artists, song_title, estimated_release_year)
  - Engagement metrics (like_dislike_to_views_ratio)
- `channels` - YouTube channel information and processing state
- `video_features` - Karaoke-specific features with confidence scores
- `quality_scores` - Technical, engagement, and metadata quality metrics
- `ryd_data` - Return YouTube Dislike data with confidence scoring
- `search_history` - Track search performance over time
- `error_log` - Debugging and monitoring

### Performance Optimizations:
‚úÖ **15+ database indexes** - Optimized for large-scale queries  
‚úÖ **Connection pooling** - Handles high-concurrency operations  
‚úÖ **Memory management** - Bounded caches prevent memory exhaustion  
‚úÖ **Rate limiting** - Prevents API blocking with smart backoff  
‚úÖ **Incremental processing** - Only processes new videos on subsequent runs

### Key Fields Collected:
‚úÖ **YouTube URL** - Direct video links  
‚úÖ **Title** - Full video title  
‚úÖ **Original artist** - Extracted with confidence scoring  
‚úÖ **Featured artists** - "feat./ft./featuring" collaborations  
‚úÖ **Release year** - Via MusicBrainz API lookup  
‚úÖ **Video length** - Duration in seconds  
‚úÖ **View count** - Current view statistics  
‚úÖ **Like/dislike ratio** - Computed engagement metric  
‚úÖ **Karaoke features** - Guide vocals, lyrics style, instrumentals

## Development

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -e ".[dev]"

# Keep yt-dlp updated for YouTube API changes
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp

# Run tests with coverage
pytest

# Run linting with auto-fix
ruff check . --fix

# Format code with black
black .

# Type checking (if using mypy/pylance)
# VS Code with Pylance provides excellent type checking support

# Install pre-commit hooks (if available)
pre-commit install
```

### Code Quality Tools

The project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

- **pytest** - Testing framework with coverage reporting
- **ruff** - Fast Python linter with auto-fix capabilities  
- **black** - Code formatting for consistent style
- **Pylance/mypy** - Type checking for better code reliability

### Debugging and Development Tools

- **debug_extraction.py** - Debug script for testing title parsing patterns
- **Comprehensive test suite** - Unit tests for all major components
- **Database migration system** - Automatic schema updates
- **Performance monitoring** - Built-in statistics tracking

### üîÑ **Staying Current with YouTube Changes**

YouTube often changes its internal APIs. Keep your collector working by upgrading yt-dlp:

```bash
# Update to the latest yt-dlp
pip install --upgrade yt-dlp

# Check for breaking changes
karaoke-collector collect -q "test" -m 5 --verbose
```

**Pro Tip:** yt-dlp releases nightly builds that patch new YouTube restrictions. The collector automatically benefits from these updates! üöÄ

## Recent Improvements

- ‚úÖ **Enhanced regex patterns** - Fixed artist-song extraction for better accuracy
- ‚úÖ **Type safety improvements** - Resolved Pylance type checking issues  
- ‚úÖ **Code formatting** - Applied black formatting for consistent style
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive testing** - All tests passing with coverage reporting
- ‚úÖ **Advanced parser stability** - Improved PatternStats dataclass handling

## Testing

The package includes comprehensive tests with coverage reporting:

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage (configured in pytest.ini)
pytest

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_db.py -v

# Run tests with coverage report
pytest --cov-report=html

# Skip slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Test Configuration
Tests are configured with:
- Coverage reporting (HTML and terminal)  
- Strict markers for test categorization
- Support for unit/integration test separation
- Warning suppression for cleaner output
