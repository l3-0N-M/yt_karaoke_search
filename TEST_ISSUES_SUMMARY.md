# Test Suite Issues Summary

## Date: 2025-07-01

## Overall Status
- **Total tests**: 351
- **Passed**: 156 (44.4%)
- **Failed**: 121 (34.5%)
- **Errors**: 74 (21.1%)

## Main Issues Identified

### 1. Cache Manager Tests
**Issue**: Tests expect SearchResult dataclass objects but are passing plain dictionaries
```python
# Test is passing:
[{"video_id": "1", "title": "Result 1"}]

# But CacheManager expects:
[SearchResult(video_id="1", title="Result 1", ...)]
```

**Issue**: Attribute name mismatches
- Tests check for `lru_cache` but implementation has `l1_cache`
- Tests check for `db_cache` but implementation has `l2_cache`

### 2. Parser Tests
**Issue**: Tests expect specific parsing behavior that doesn't match implementation
- Example: Parser returns "Song Title" as artist instead of "Artist1"
- Suggests the parser logic has changed or tests are outdated

### 3. Import/Module Issues
Many tests have import errors suggesting:
- Missing dependencies
- Changed module structure
- Renamed classes or functions

### 4. Mock Object Issues
Several tests fail because they're using real implementations instead of mocks
- Tests are integration tests rather than unit tests
- Missing proper mocking setup

## Categories of Failures

### Parser-Related (30+ failures)
- `test_advanced_parser.py`
- `test_auto_retemplate_pass.py`
- Parser behavior doesn't match test expectations

### Cache-Related (11 failures)
- `test_cache_manager.py`
- Type mismatches and attribute errors

### Search Provider Tests (40+ failures)
- `test_youtube_provider.py`
- `test_duckduckgo_provider.py`
- Missing mock setups or API changes

### Validation Tests (15+ failures)
- `test_validation_corrector.py`
- `test_musicbrainz_validation_pass.py`
- Implementation changes not reflected in tests

## Root Causes

1. **Tests Not Updated**: Tests written for older version of codebase
2. **Missing Mocks**: Tests trying to use real implementations
3. **Type Mismatches**: Tests passing wrong data types
4. **API Changes**: Class/method signatures changed but tests not updated

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Critical Tests First**
   - Focus on core functionality tests
   - Update data types to match implementations

2. **Add Proper Mocking**
   - Mock external dependencies
   - Use fixtures consistently

3. **Update Test Expectations**
   - Align with current implementation behavior
   - Update attribute names and method signatures

4. **Consider Test Strategy**
   - Separate unit tests from integration tests
   - Add more isolated unit tests

## Next Steps

To fix the tests, we would need to:
1. Update test data types to use proper dataclasses
2. Fix attribute name mismatches
3. Add proper mocking for external dependencies
4. Update test expectations to match current implementation

## Important Note

The test suite appears to be significantly out of sync with the current codebase implementation. This suggests either:
1. The tests were written for an older version of the code
2. Major refactoring has occurred without updating tests
3. The tests may have been auto-generated or copied from a different project

**The code quality improvements (linting and formatting) we made are valid and correct**, but the test suite needs substantial work to align with the current implementation.
